An experiment in showing how multiple values are layered for the CSS `background-image` property.

Go play with it at <http://ecssplain.github.io/background-image-layers/>.

This code started as demos for [“Gradient Circus”](http://gilmoreorless.github.io/sydcss-preso-gradient-circus/), a presentation about gradients for the [SydCSS](http://sydcss.com/) user group. It has since been split out into this repository, and the plan is to build it up into a decent standalone tool.

Whether that plan actually eventuates is another matter...
